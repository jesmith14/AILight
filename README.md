Almost everything nowadays has an element of “smart” to it- from smartphones, to smart TVs, to even AI assistants in our cars. This is exactly what Philips Hue was trying to do with the Lighting Industry - make smart lighting. The whole purpose of smart lighting is to reduce energy consumption at the same time as providing an ambient and aesthetic user experience. The history of the lighting goes all the way back to Thomas Edison in 1879 and we have come a long way since. After the light bulb was invented the next most prominent lighting invention was the LED light. LED stands for Light-Emitting Diode and is a type of solid-state lighting. The science behind the LED light is that it uses a semiconductor to convert electricity into light in order to reduce the need for reflectors and diffusers that trap light. In addition to this, they are the most efficient bulbs on the market today. Philips Hue revolutionized this by creating a product that incorporates ease, aesthetic, and efficiency. 

The way the Philips Hue Lighting System works is that you can connect a range of lights from their system to one “bridge” which connects to your home router. Then when you log into the app using the same wifi you can connect to the bridge and get a clean UI interface to manage all the lights in your home. With the click of one button you could turn off the lights downstairs or change the color of your lamp in your bedroom to an ambient blue color. 

Because of how unique and impactful this lighting system is we have decided to use the Philips Hue SDK to connect with the lighting system for our AI project. The purpose and goal of our project is to change the color of the ambient lighting in the area/room depending on the outside weather. We plan on achieving this goal with a simple iOS app. This app would get information about the weather at the user’s current location using either the Open Weather API or the Dark Sky API. It would then parse this information and use it to predict an ambient color for the room. The app would use the Philips iOS SDK in order to connect to the Philips Hue Lightbulb and change the color of the light. For example, when it is rainy outside with a temperature of 60 degrees fahrenheit, the color would be light blue and when it’s sunny outside, the color would be light bright yellow. 

The AI component of this project consists of logging when a user changes the lighting. Our system will log the time, color, and intensity of the lights. Our system will be trained by this user behavior and it will use this information to predict what the lighting scheme should be.

Our device is meant to change the mood of the space based on weather through ambient lighting as well as provide useful information to the user about the weather outside. This is intended for any household or anyone who likes ambient/aesthetic lighting. People who frequently use the Philips Hue Light System would be our target audience. In conclusion, we hope to improve the user experience and enhance the Philips Hue Lighting System.
